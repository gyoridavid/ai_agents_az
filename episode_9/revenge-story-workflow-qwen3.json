Your task is take the input, enhance it and create an engaging, fictionalized revenge story from it.\n\n<instructions>\n1. Use the plot structure below to create the story\n2. Use the provided character name, age, sex and location. Make sure to customize the story so it fits the sex of the character.\n3. The story should be told in first person\n4. Make the reading level 8th grade\n5. Don't use acronyms, use the long version of every turn. The text will be used turned into speech with TTS.\n6. Don't create paragraphs, don't format the text, use clear and continous text\n7. The story should be very long\n8. Write the story in {{ $('Setup language').item.json.language }} ({{ $('Configuration for story writing').item.json.lang_code }}) language. Make sure it sounds authentic.\n\nPlot structure\n\n- **Act 1: The character is in a situation with a problem.**\n    - Introduce the character, their world, and their place in it. What is interesting or intriguing about this character and their life? Describe any distinctive qualities, and create empathy with them.\n    - Something happens to shake the character’s world, or they find themselves in a new situation, creating a threat or opportunity. What problem does the character have to solve? How is the character unsatisfied with how things currently are? Who has appeared as their nemesis?\n- **Act 2: They try to solve the problem, but fail, making it worse.**\n    - Character begins to make efforts to solve their problem. They face a series of hurdles or conflicts, each of increasing difficulty and stakes. Some they win, some they lose. The original problem begins to grow bigger and more serious.\n    - In order for the high of the climax to have the greatest effect, take the character as low as they can go. Despite all the progress they’ve made against external and internal obstacles, something should happen which makes them certain that all may be lost.\n- **Act 3: They make a final attempt to solve the problem, which may succeed or fail. The consequence is not always as expected.**\n    - Bring to a climax. The character makes a final, last ditch effort to solve their problem. They must dig deep to find that last bit of strength and courage, and risk everything they have to make one final attempt. May involve a confrontation between the character and their nemesis.\n    - Depending on the type of story being written, this effort can solve the problem or destroy everything. The consequences of their choice must be poetic. In vast majority of cases, the character is rewarded for their action or decision and be fulfilled.\n    - Bring to a resolution. Show the character’s new normal, how they may have changed, and tie up any loose ends. As close to the end as possible, there could be an unexpected twist to leave a parting thrill.\n</instructions>\n\n<character>\n<name>{{ $json.output.name }}</name>\n<age>{{ $json.output.age }}</age>\n<location>{{ $json.output.location }}</location>\n<sex>{{ $json.output.sex }}</sex>\n</character>\n\n<reddit_revenge_story>\n<title>{{ $('Get the next story to process').item.json.title }}</title>\n<content>\n{{ $('Get the next story to process').item.json.content }}\n</content>\n</reddit_revenge_story>\n\n/no_think",

Shortly after, her new boyfriend moves in. Seems like a decent and innocent man, although a bit nervous and insecure. Fast forward to Christmas last year, and he asks her to get engaged and he wants to help pay the mortgage. There's just the small fact that he needs to be signed as an owner of the house in order to be equally responsible of the mortgage. My sister signs the paperwork, because they are gonna get engaged and start a family (that's at least what he manipulated her to think).\n\n\nWell, almost immediately after she signs the papers he does a 180 and turns into a massive sh*thole. Things get worse and worse and he's becoming verbally abusive on almost a daily basis. She asks him to move out, and he basically says \"no I own half of the house, and half of everything in it, and we're going to sell the house and I'm going to get half the profit and half of the furniture, and I'm not moving until then\". \n\n\nAll of this is obviously premeditated by him. He works in banking and real estate so he knows what he's doing and he knows that there's a very real possibility he can walk away with 20k from a house he never paid for or even changed a f*cking toilet roll in all while my sister has to give up her dream house.\n\n\nWe don't live in the US and we have lawyers so no legal advice needed, I just want to quite literally ruin his life. Any suggestions? \n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your help. I'm planning my revenge and I'm going to implement some of your suggestions. The revenge will be calculated, slow and hopefully life wrecking so he won't do this to another person again. I will reply to each and every comment when I have time\n\n\nEDIT2: My sister has asked me to not do anything considered to be illegal in our country of residence, so I will reconsider some of the options I have. There is however pee all over his car. Must have been the neighbours cats again. Oh and he's already been offered some help from various religious groups, bless his soul.\n\nEDIT3: Currently working on relocating my sister and all her belongings to a safe place since he's started to claim he can have half of her furniture too (he hasn't bought anything except a tv). So we are planning on emptying the entire house in one day and then cut the water and the power.

They can reduce my monthly bill by 40%, he claimed.  This is a scam that's been happening, and I knew it was when he asked me what my monthly bill is.  \"If you work for Telus you would know that.\"  I told him, and he said I was right and hung up.  About an hour later same call, different guy.  I told him to remove my number from the calling list and he just goes \"nanana nana\" in a mocking tone before he hung up.  That pissed me off.  I was waiting for them to call again, but they didn't for the rest of the day.\n\nYesterday, in the afternoon my phone rings and it's them.  I'm going to waste as much of their time as possible.  Same spiel as last time, 40% off my monthly bill, what is it?  I told them my last bill was $2.15.  No that's not right he said, my bill needs to be at least $20/month to apply.  Ok let me go back to the previous month... $42 dollars.  I qualify for a free new Iphone too, if I'm a senior, so I tell him I'm very senior.  What's my date of birth?  August 17, 1901.  He questioned the year, but in more of a do I have this correct way than you were born over 100 years ago way.  I don't know how I managed to stay dead pan and not let out a giggle as that red flag went over his head.  Let's see what else I can get away with.  My email address?  Yes let me spell it for you M. A. N. M. E. E. T. B. A. L. L. D. E. E. P. At gmail dot com.  His accent was thick, the t's and p's sound the same so I say it. \"Manmeet Balldeep.  Manmeet Balldeep in your ass.\" That went flying right over his head and he just comes back with \"it says that's not a valid email.\"  Well your systems are wrong I say.  Then he asks me for my credit card number, so I read him the number off my pepsi's bar code.  Then he asks for my driver's license number.  I don't have one, I'm too old to drive.  So he asks for any kind of ID, I offer a student ID from 1955.  He tells me to wait, I get put on hold and transfers me to somebody else, the whole process starts again, same questions same replies.  \n\nThis second guy had one or two more braincells than the first though, because when I told him my email address and followed it up with the \"Manmeet Balldeep in your ass\" he goes \"what did you say?\"  \"I said Manmeet Balldeep.\"  After that? He asked.  \"I said Manmeet Balldeep is my name.\" He continues but I knew I almost blew it.  He gets my date of birth and asks if I'm really 125 years old, I say no, I'm 123 and I'll be 124 in August.  He asks for my driver's license, no don't drive, and he won't take a student ID.  How about a passport?  No to that.  He asks for my address, so I gave him the address of the closest police station.  Ok now you want my credit card number?  I read the barcode again to him.  That's not right he said, a visa starts with 4, so I tell him the barcode again starting with a four.  \"But that's only 13 numbers, I think you are wasting my time sir.\"\n\n\"You're god damn right I am.\"",

They can reduce my monthly bill by 40%, he claimed.  This is a scam that&amp;#39;s been happening, and I knew it was when he asked me what my monthly bill is.  &amp;quot;If you work for Telus you would know that.&amp;quot;  I told him, and he said I was right and hung up.  About an hour later same call, different guy.  I told him to remove my number from the calling list and he just goes &amp;quot;nanana nana&amp;quot; in a mocking tone before he hung up.  That pissed me off.  I was waiting for them to call again, but they didn&amp;#39;t for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, in the afternoon my phone rings and it&amp;#39;s them.  I&amp;#39;m going to waste as much of their time as possible.  Same spiel as last time, 40% off my monthly bill, what is it?  I told them my last bill was $2.15.  No that&amp;#39;s not right he said, my bill needs to be at least $20/month to apply.  Ok let me go back to the previous month... $42 dollars.  I qualify for a free new Iphone too, if I&amp;#39;m a senior, so I tell him I&amp;#39;m very senior.  What&amp;#39;s my date of birth?  August 17, 1901.  He questioned the year, but in more of a do I have this correct way than you were born over 100 years ago way.  I don&amp;#39;t know how I managed to stay dead pan and not let out a giggle as that red flag went over his head.  Let&amp;#39;s see what else I can get away with.  My email address?  Yes let me spell it for you M. A. N. M. E. E. T. B. A. L. L. D. E. E. P. At gmail dot com.  His accent was thick, the t&amp;#39;s and p&amp;#39;s sound the same so I say it. &amp;quot;Manmeet Balldeep.  Manmeet Balldeep in your ass.&amp;quot; That went flying right over his head and he just comes back with &amp;quot;it says that&amp;#39;s not a valid email.&amp;quot;  Well your systems are wrong I say.  Then he asks me for my credit card number, so I read him the number off my pepsi&amp;#39;s bar code.  Then he asks for my driver&amp;#39;s license number.  I don&amp;#39;t have one, I&amp;#39;m too old to drive.  So he asks for any kind of ID, I offer a student ID from 1955.  He tells me to wait, I get put on hold and transfers me to somebody else, the whole process starts again, same questions same replies.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This second guy had one or two more braincells than the first though, because when I told him my email address and followed it up with the &amp;quot;Manmeet Balldeep in your ass&amp;quot; he goes &amp;quot;what did you say?&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;I said Manmeet Balldeep.&amp;quot;  After that? He asked.  &amp;quot;I said Manmeet Balldeep is my name.&amp;quot; He continues but I knew I almost blew it.  He gets my date of birth and asks if I&amp;#39;m really 125 years old, I say no, I&amp;#39;m 123 and I&amp;#39;ll be 124 in August.  He asks for my driver&amp;#39;s license, no don&amp;#39;t drive, and he won&amp;#39;t take a student ID.  How about a passport?  No to that.  He asks for my address, so I gave him the address of the closest police station.  Ok now you want my credit card number?  I read the barcode again to him.  That&amp;#39;s not right he said, a visa starts with 4, so I tell him the barcode again starting with a four.  &amp;quot;But that&amp;#39;s only 13 numbers, I think you are wasting my time sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re god damn right I am.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                  "selftext": "Sorry so long, but I love telling this story...\n\nBack in 2015, I (37F) was working as a Manufacturing Engineer for a fishing company.  I had been there for almost 5 years and worked with new packaging line implementation mainly but the Process Engineer had quit so I picked up that job also.  I was working 16 hour days most of the time and on call 24/7 but felt that I would be able to rise in the ranks if I showed my dedication to the company.\n\nCue Douchehead Manager.  For some reason, he didn't like me and would try to make me look incompetent and weak in front of other departments.  Criticized my ideas, but then gave the ideas to others to do.  Everyone else worried about me and the hours I was putting in (and drinking 2-3 Monsters a day) but my manager just wanted more.\n\nThen came the first of the month.  I came into work and started back on a line teardown that needed to be done.  I was wrenching away when I started hearing people being called into HR.  I was confused.  What was going on?  I went to talk to my work besties and they were just as confused.  As I walked back to my cubicle, I saw one of the women from accounting crying as she carried out a box of her stuff while being escorted.  I remember hearing her name being called.  My heart fell to my stomach.\n\nThen, around 8:30AM, I heard it.  MY name being called.  I thought, well, so much for dedication.  Walked into HR, got the \"position elimination\" lecture and was informed I had no job, no insurance, and 4 months of pay ( for just 1 month shy of 5 years).  I was destroyed!  I had NEVER received a bad review or even a PIP!  But my manager had to pick one person from his department and low and behold, he chose me.\n\nI had to be escorted back to my desk to pack up.  Tears streaming down my face and my packaging ME shouting \"This is BS!\" as he had to walk me out.  The manager wouldn't even give me the chance to say anything to him, just made his 2nd in command walk me out.  And the kicker?  My birthday was the next day.\n\nAs the day progressed, I heard about more people being let go.  At least one person from each department and a couple of managers (they were close to retirement).  Out of them all, 90% were women, including a couple of work besties.  We found the conglomerate that owned the company was selling it and we were the fall out for making the books look good.  I still didn't understand why I was chosen from the engineering department!  There was one person who was one year from retirement who would have GLADLY left (his words to me) and another on a PIP (he told me so I could help him).  I was shattered and lost.\n\nSo I took one day to grieve (and get drunk with my besties on my birthday) then hit the job sites.  One month later, I started a new job that I absolutely loved!!!  But here's where it gets good....\n\nOne morning, about 6 months after I started my new job, the plant director called me into his office.  His office was only about 15 feet from my cubical so we got to know each other and he was a pretty cool guy so I walked in with a \"What's up?\" and a smile.  He looks up and says \"I have a resume for the plant manager position.  You used to work at That Fishing Place, didn't you?\".  I said I did.  \"Did you know or work with Douchehead Manager?\".  I said \"Yes, he was my manager\".  \"How was he to work for/with?\".  I smiled and said \"He was an ok person, but he was a REALLY great bus driver, if you get what I mean.\"\n\nHe smiled, picked up the paper and showed it to me.  It was Douchehead's resume and he had been let go the SAME DAY I WAS!  I was in shock!  And then, the best thing happened.  The director took the paper, ripped it up, and threw it away!  He said that was all he needed to know and I walked out with my jaw dropped!  Douchebead had been unemployed since that day and unknowingly, I got my petty revenge!",

I had been there for almost 5 years and worked with new packaging line implementation mainly but the Process Engineer had quit so I picked up that job also.  I was working 16 hour days most of the time and on call 24/7 but felt that I would be able to rise in the ranks if I showed my dedication to the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cue Douchehead Manager.  For some reason, he didn&amp;#39;t like me and would try to make me look incompetent and weak in front of other departments.  Criticized my ideas, but then gave the ideas to others to do.  Everyone else worried about me and the hours I was putting in (and drinking 2-3 Monsters a day) but my manager just wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came the first of the month.  I came into work and started back on a line teardown that needed to be done.  I was wrenching away when I started hearing people being called into HR.  I was confused.  What was going on?  I went to talk to my work besties and they were just as confused.  As I walked back to my cubicle, I saw one of the women from accounting crying as she carried out a box of her stuff while being escorted.  I remember hearing her name being called.  My heart fell to my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, around 8:30AM, I heard it.  MY name being called.  I thought, well, so much for dedication.  Walked into HR, got the &amp;quot;position elimination&amp;quot; lecture and was informed I had no job, no insurance, and 4 months of pay ( for just 1 month shy of 5 years).  I was destroyed!  I had NEVER received a bad review or even a PIP!  But my manager had to pick one person from his department and low and behold, he chose me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to be escorted back to my desk to pack up.  Tears streaming down my face and my packaging ME shouting &amp;quot;This is BS!&amp;quot; as he had to walk me out.  The manager wouldn&amp;#39;t even give me the chance to say anything to him, just made his 2nd in command walk me out.  And the kicker?  My birthday was the next day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the day progressed, I heard about more people being let go.  At least one person from each department and a couple of managers (they were close to retirement).  Out of them all, 90% were women, including a couple of work besties.  We found the conglomerate that owned the company was selling it and we were the fall out for making the books look good.  I still didn&amp;#39;t understand why I was chosen from the engineering department!  There was one person who was one year from retirement who would have GLADLY left (his words to me) and another on a PIP (he told me so I could help him).  I was shattered and lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I took one day to grieve (and get drunk with my besties on my birthday) then hit the job sites.  One month later, I started a new job that I absolutely loved!!!  But here&amp;#39;s where it gets good....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One morning, about 6 months after I started my new job, the plant director called me into his office.  His office was only about 15 feet from my cubical so we got to know each other and he was a pretty cool guy so I walked in with a &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s up?&amp;quot; and a smile.  He looks up and says &amp;quot;I have a resume for the plant manager position.  You used to work at That Fishing Place, didn&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot;.  I said I did.  &amp;quot;Did you know or work with Douchehead Manager?&amp;quot;.  I said &amp;quot;Yes, he was my manager&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;How was he to work for/with?&amp;quot;.  I smiled and said &amp;quot;He was an ok person, but he was a REALLY great bus driver, if you get what I mean.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He smiled, picked up the paper and showed it to me.  It was Douchehead&amp;#39;s resume and he had been let go the SAME DAY I WAS!  I was in shock!  And then, the best thing happened.  The director took the paper, ripped it up, and threw it away!  He said that was all he needed to know and I walked out with my jaw dropped!  Douchebead had been unemployed since that day and unknowingly, I got my petty revenge!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I was kinda messy in taking my notes, but I did it in a way I understood perfectly and in each test I got every answer right (Maybe beside one or two tests arround the year, nobody is perfect) but Mr. Dickhead started taking points for things like not using the method he asked, not being organized (Not using the colors he wanted for each part), not expanding my process (writing fast calculations like sums or substraction explicitely; we literally needed to write: 2+2=4) and nitpicks like that, so at the end of the year (LAST YEAR OF MIDDLESCHOOL) he failed me.\n\nIn here, when we fail a subject, we need to do a special exam but that also means that you cannot sign into any highschool you got accepted to (More context, I know, boring: Here usually the best highschools are the public ones or run by universities and you have to send submissions to each one, why? because getting into these means you most likely get directly into some of the best universities here NO NEED FOR SUBMISSIONS AS LONG AS YOU GET A GOOD GRADE IN THEM; they are also public, some run by the goverment some other are autonomous from the system/goverment, but all are free and graduating from these gives you the best job offers), so he more or less screwed my acceptences, and not any acceptences I got accepted into my FIRST 3 CHOICES, not safety choices, TOP CHOICES (a.k.a run by the best 3 universities in the country).\n\nSo my petty ass couldn't take it anymore and when the classroom where empty I just walked to him and said him plainly: \"See \"teacher\" you have two options, you could either just pass me with 6 (here the system rates from 1 to 10 being 6 the minimum passing score) or I could do the special exam and you will have to eat your pride and score me a 10, because I know I'll pass it with 10\". Mr. Dickhead sent me to the special exam anyways, thinking he would fail me by nitpicking again, but in this country theres a funny thing you could ask... you'll see... when you have to do this exam you could ask for a goverment \"agent\" (say a teacher sent by the goverment branch that takes care of the education system) to oversee and score INDEPENDENTLY that special exam, and that independant score MUST BE ACCEPTED BY THE TEACHER NO MATTER WHY.\n\nMost of students don't ask for one because the process is lenghty and slow so it's a bother, but I did, fueled by anger and pettiness I went through each step of the process with extreme care and filled EVERY FORM this goverment institution sent me to request the \"agent\".\n\nSo when the day came, I entered the classroom the exam was taken in and a few minutes latter lo and behold... the goverment \"agent\", I started taking my exam, and when I gave my exam back Mr.dickhead tried to take it back but the agent stepped in and took the exam and said \"that's for me\"; he started scoring immediately and just as I said, perfect score, and the agent just put a big red 10 in the paper in front of the teacher saying \"this student passed\" (I also saved some other students who Mr.Dickhead failed), the best image of that moment left in my memory is seeing his face turning completely red as I left the classroom, sweet sweet memory, nobody but me and the teacher know about this interaction but it always bring a smile to my face that Mr. Dickhead got a little of \"karma\"\n\nAfter that I had to go to a private highschool since I didn't wanted to wait a year for doing the admissions again, and as for the universities I had to make submissions for them, I got accepted into my first choice and that was it.\n\nI know it's not like those stories from here in which a student stands up in front of the class and challenge the teacher directly ending up like a school legend, but as my mother said \"Bad teachers also give you lessons\" and she knows because she is also a teacher (middleschool and highschool; also funny enough she teaches math, so thats why I got hold of the subject and knew better methods and ways of solving problems) and me... I ended up becoming a (Highschool and university) teacher and a researcher (Nothing math focused, I liked math but not enough to study something related to it).\n\nNow if you expect an ending in which all came back to him or I met him again just to rub off how far I came, sorry to disapoint you, I just saw that Mr. Dickhead once more, riding a bus back to the same middleschool while I was going to uni, I didn't talked to him nor gave him a second look, he just looked older.\n\nAs for my life now, I'm just looking at some options to do my masters degree, probably in something related to forensic sciences, so wish me luck getting accepted XD",

                  "selftext": "My mother lives on a court, right before the actual circle starts. About two years ago, the house across the street from my mother’s went up for sale and somebody bought it and turned it into a rental. The family that lives in the rental is a husband and wife and three kids all old enough to drive. I need help or ideas on how to be petty or get revenge on one of the kids that continuously parks inconveniently.  \n\nAs far as I can tell all the kids are out of high school and most of them work if not all of them, the one I have an issue with we will call her Karen. Karen works odd hours. I’m not sure what she does where she works anything like that but she leaves at various times throughout the week. She always parks on the street right in front of my mother‘s house, which I understand parking on the street is legal and it’s public property, we do not have an issue with that at all. The issue is the fact that the part right in front of my mother‘s house can hold two cars comfortably, but Karen parks right in the middle so she is the only one that is able to park there. She does not have a brand new car, it’s not an expensive car or anything like that and the street isn’t busy, it’s a court. . I have asked both the father and mother on separate occasions to tell Karen to pull up further so that other people can park in front of the house if they need, and he said that he would talk to her nothing changed. \n\nThe other week my mom happened to be outside when Karen was leaving, and she asked Karen to pull forward more when she parks so another car can park behind her when my mom has visitors. Karen told my mom to “go fuck herself” and then a day or two after that my mom and Karen both came home at the same time. My mother pulled into her garage and when she came out, Karen waited for her just to flip her off before she went into her house. So now I’m pissed and would like some ideas. We have an extra vehicle we can park in that spot but we have to wait for Karen to leave, and we can only be parked in a spot for 48 house before we need to move per the covenant rules. Any ideas?\n\nAlso, there is a ton of street parking in front of their own house but they refuse to park there. Idk why, it’s not illegal and wouldn’t be blocking anyone else. ",

About two years ago, the house across the street from my mother’s went up for sale and somebody bought it and turned it into a rental. The family that lives in the rental is a husband and wife and three kids all old enough to drive. I need help or ideas on how to be petty or get revenge on one of the kids that continuously parks inconveniently.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell all the kids are out of high school and most of them work if not all of them, the one I have an issue with we will call her Karen. Karen works odd hours. I’m not sure what she does where she works anything like that but she leaves at various times throughout the week. She always parks on the street right in front of my mother‘s house, which I understand parking on the street is legal and it’s public property, we do not have an issue with that at all. The issue is the fact that the part right in front of my mother‘s house can hold two cars comfortably, but Karen parks right in the middle so she is the only one that is able to park there. She does not have a brand new car, it’s not an expensive car or anything like that and the street isn’t busy, it’s a court. . I have asked both the father and mother on separate occasions to tell Karen to pull up further so that other people can park in front of the house if they need, and he said that he would talk to her nothing changed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other week my mom happened to be outside when Karen was leaving, and she asked Karen to pull forward more when she parks so another car can park behind her when my mom has visitors. Karen told my mom to “go fuck herself” and then a day or two after that my mom and Karen both came home at the same time. My mother pulled into her garage and when she came out, Karen waited for her just to flip her off before she went into her house. So now I’m pissed and would like some ideas. We have an extra vehicle we can park in that spot but we have to wait for Karen to leave, and we can only be parked in a spot for 48 house before we need to move per the covenant rules. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also, there is a ton of street parking in front of their own house but they refuse to park there. Idk why, it’s not illegal and wouldn’t be blocking anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

He tried doing something extremely generous for me and the thief ruined Christmas. \n\nHe relays everything to me on the phone after he reported the devices as stolen at the police station. \n\n______________________________\n\n                         ★★★\n______________________________\n\nSome time passes. \n\nApple apparently did NOT immediately flag IMEI/MEID as stolen for both devices. My guess is they wanted to see where these devices ended up, see if the thief were stupid enough to USE/SELL IT etc.\n\nThis significantly delayed the gift from being given to me because Apple had to wait until after the investigation was complete to file the insurance claim or something (it’s been YEARS so I don’t remember precisely what the holdup was, but I think substantial inventory shortages also played a significant role in the delay as well).\n\nMy boyfriend was OBVIOUSLY extremely upset, stressed out, annoyed, and panicked, but he took the PD report paper, left the precinct and told me to trust the process and let law enforcement do their thing.\n\nSpent Christmas with our families. I refused to accept any replacement Christmas present of monetary value after the whole theft package ordeal, so he decided to gift me thoughtful homemade gifts instead:\n\n• some artwork (he was really talented at creating paintings)\n\n• gave me chocolates\n\n• made me a cute coupon gift thing where I could redeem the ticket/coupons for cute things like a home cooked dinner, massage, get him to do my laundry/clean our apartment etc.\n\nDespite us being IRRITATED/stressed out, I did end up using his brother’s iPhone 5 to fall back on while I bided my time and waited for law enforcement to share an update with my boyfriend.\n\nI also had operational laptop to hold me over, but it was a 2009 MacBook Pro that no longer connected to the internet without a hardwire internet ethernet cable (which was FRUSTRATING BEYOND BELIEF). \n\n______________________________\n\n                         ★★★\n______________________________\n\n\nWent on with our lives as normal. \n\nHe’d occasionally get EXTREMELY limited updates from the investigators, but it more or less went on the back-burner while we were generally preoccupied with our lives/jobs/families/careers/school etc.\n\nSeasons change, birthdays happen, it’s now mid-to-late springtime and starts to feel like it’s almost summer when my boyfriend gets another update and this ends up being a SIGNIFICANT update.\n\nSurely enough, because it was an unlocked/unrestricted iPhone from Apple (he paid it off upfront in full), the jackass decided not to go sell it, but instead, waited a few WEEKS and then used the stolen iPhone for HIS OWN DEVICE UPGRADE.\n\nNeedless to say, dude was COOKED.\n\n______________________________\n\n                         ★★★\n______________________________\n\n\nWarrants and subpoenas got served on the devices and the person/people it was tracked back to. Even thief’s HOUSE. From there, they were able to obtain evidence of a lot of OTHER theft reports he was suspected of being involved in.\n\nTurns out, dude was a notorious package thief involved in a massive, bigger theft package thieve ring, and apparently he was already on PD radar for QUITE SOME TIME.\n\nI didn’t get many details, he was only was told about HIS particular package thief. I don’t have specifics as this was HIS case, HIS purchase, and HIS package missing.\n\nThief dude had also listed my new laptop on one of those selling platforms that facilitates in-person meetups. I forgot which one. \n\nAn under cover cop went through the whole process to try to meet up with him to buy the laptop. In person. \n\nIt. Was. Perfect. \n\n______________________________\n\n                         ★★★\n______________________________\n\n\nThe dude turned out to be THE DELIVERY DRIVER and he was so messy that he had done shit like this so much that his job and the cops were already on top of it. \n\nThey apparently suspected the dude pretty early on in the investigation.\n\nMy boyfriend’s case was one of dozens that was involved a substantially larger sting operation that spanned across the metro area on the East Coast. \n\nI don’t remember if thief dude got sentenced to repay restitution, but Apple did end up eventually shipping the replacement devices to my boyfriend’s parents local Apple Store —— he wanted to be 100% sure they’d be successfully delivered this time!\n\n______________________________\n\n                         ★★★\n______________________________\n\n\nIt took FOREVER before I got my replacement gifts.\n\nI was able to get my gifts as promised fully delivered and in my possession after July 4th. \n\nLaptop was replaced much earlier than the iPhone (it was mid-semester right after midterms) but I don’t remember exactly when. \n\nIt took a couple months, but after he was told everything that happened, it was worth it tbh. \n\nTLDR: package thief repeat offender steals expensive tech package, FAFO, gets busted and exposed for multiple thefts and being in a bigger package theft ring, gets significant time in federal prison.",

                  "selftext": "When I (30, F) met Dan (43, M) in March 2021, he portrayed himself as this grounded, independent man. He was a convert to Islam. He had his own flat, a car, the latest Apple products, and had just returned from studying in Egypt for two years. It was a carefully curated image — spiritual, self-sufficient, and mature. I thought I’d found someone solid.\n\nWe got married Islamically within a few weeks. But within months, I found myself footing the bill for everything — meals, outings. I couldn’t go to his flat because he had a male “lodger” and needed the additional income to travel to Scotland to see his parents and be a dutiful son. He encouraged me to take out rented accommodation on my name, with the stipulation that he would foot the rent. This was far from the truth and he had every excuse under the sun: his parents in Scotland needed support, his remote employer was not paying him on time, his bills for his own place was too much due to cost of living increase, etc. To shut me up, he would contribute £50-100 here and there, then conveniently make me cover other things to “balance” it out.\n\nHe spoke about his car needing repairs, and I gave him £400 thinking I was being a supportive wife. In December 2021, we even went on a holiday to my home country of the Seychelles — paid for by me. I was determined to put reality behind me for the duration of the holiday and have a good time. And that we did - I saw my country through a different lens - of luxury- and we discussed plans of spending more time here in this lush greenery and by the golden sandy beaches. \n\nOne thing about Dan is that he knows how to live it up on someone else’s money. He is never overt with what he wants but will suggest things we could both do which would be enjoyable. And he would be the perfect, most attentive man to your needs - bring you water, cook you breakfast, put your shoes on, make engaging, charming small talk with relatives, ask if you need to slow down and rest and more. \n\nAnyway, so 2 days after we got back to the UK, he drops the BIGGEST bombshell: he has two other wives (religious, not legal). One in Scotland and one in Egypt. I was stunned. I felt sick. I couldn’t believe someone could lie so easily and so deeply. \n\nCaveat: I am not against polygyny, so long as it’s done with clear intentions of supporting women and with transparency and consent of all involved. \n\n10 days later, one of them, Nadia (F, 50), contacted me. She told me he was a serial cheater who hid behind a religious mask — and that he had a long pattern of using women. I wanted to believe she was lying. But deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.\n\nIt turned out the lifestyle he flaunted when we met — the flat, the car, the tech — wasn’t his doing at all. It was her money. Nadia was a civil servant, and she was the one paying rent on both his London and Scotland flats, covering all the bills, and she owned the car he drove. She had even given him a credit card with a £2000 limit! He had been living off her income and making himself appear self-made.\n\nAnd worse? Nadia was the “lodger” living in the flat he said was his. \n\nI kept trying to make peace with the situation, despite paying £1,000+ a month in rent and bills on my own. He wasn’t helping. Eventually I reached a breaking point. It was more of an implosion than explosion. Emotionally detached and almost out of my own body, I quietly analysed him. He was a man who triangulated women and extracted from them as much as he could, to enable himself to live a “soft life”. I deeped how there was no love for me at all from his end and his manipulation gave me the “ick” that I could not unsee. And so I set a trap. I told him I planned to move back to the Seychelles and build a new life. I started taking actions towards this. Started talking about my dreams of living luxuriously and used examples of things we did on holiday there to build the picture of what life would be. I was also the picture of acceptance - discussing how he would need to be here in dreary England for half the year to be with his other wife as that’s what is islamically fair. I stopped reacting. I stopped clinging. I made space for myself and emotionally detached. \n\nAnd that’s when he started chasing me.\n\nNadia couldn’t handle it. She became increasingly anxious and threatened to harm herself if he left her. But he started pulling away from her more and more. She would send him increasingly more money to lure him back. He would say such terrible things about her. I am certain that with her, he would say terrible things about me. Eventually she walked in on us one day at his flat and had a breakdown. I had told him that if he wanted me to be a co-wife, this meant that any property in his name was equally shared and to inform her of this. I guess he didn’t. She stormed in, called me a whore over the phone to his mum. Then simultaneously held my hand and asked if I needed help to leave him. She was a husk of a person. This is what 7 years of hope and longing and disappointment - so much disappointment - had done to her. She packed up her stuff and left. She stole a few of his things in the process but to be fair, she did buy them. And to this day, he is not over that. \n\nAnd I? I stayed. But I set new terms. I wasn’t paying rent or bills anymore. This was his flat, his responsibility. I reminded him of his Islamic obligations as a husband and told him I’d walk away if he couldn’t meet them. \n\nHis face was a picture of shocked panic and horror. He had lost Nadia, his prized cash cow. He had made the wrong move. He had misread my intentions completely. He was so focused on his own deception that he did not expect to be deceived.

I hope you are well and healed and whole again. \n\nTL;DR:\nI (F30) married M (43) thinking he was a self-made man — he had a flat, car, the latest tech, and claimed to have just returned from studying in Egypt. Turns out, his other secret wife (F50), a civil servant, was funding everything — she paid for both his London and Scotland flats, bills, car, and even gave him a credit card with a £2,000 limit. I unknowingly took on his financial burdens too, paying rent, holidays, repairs, and more. He finally admitted to having two other wives. I slowly detached, stood my ground, and reversed the power dynamic — emotionally and financially. Now, I'm healing, rebuilding, and no longer blaming myself for the abuse.\n",

                  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I (30, F) met Dan (43, M) in March 2021, he portrayed himself as this grounded, independent man. He was a convert to Islam. He had his own flat, a car, the latest Apple products, and had just returned from studying in Egypt for two years. It was a carefully curated image — spiritual, self-sufficient, and mature. I thought I’d found someone solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We got married Islamically within a few weeks. But within months, I found myself footing the bill for everything — meals, outings. I couldn’t go to his flat because he had a male “lodger” and needed the additional income to travel to Scotland to see his parents and be a dutiful son. He encouraged me to take out rented accommodation on my name, with the stipulation that he would foot the rent. This was far from the truth and he had every excuse under the sun: his parents in Scotland needed support, his remote employer was not paying him on time, his bills for his own place was too much due to cost of living increase, etc. To shut me up, he would contribute £50-100 here and there, then conveniently make me cover other things to “balance” it out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He spoke about his car needing repairs, and I gave him £400 thinking I was being a supportive wife. In December 2021, we even went on a holiday to my home country of the Seychelles — paid for by me. I was determined to put reality behind me for the duration of the holiday and have a good time. And that we did - I saw my country through a different lens - of luxury- and we discussed plans of spending more time here in this lush greenery and by the golden sandy beaches. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing about Dan is that he knows how to live it up on someone else’s money. He is never overt with what he wants but will suggest things we could both do which would be enjoyable. And he would be the perfect, most attentive man to your needs - bring you water, cook you breakfast, put your shoes on, make engaging, charming small talk with relatives, ask if you need to slow down and rest and more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so 2 days after we got back to the UK, he drops the BIGGEST bombshell: he has two other wives (religious, not legal). One in Scotland and one in Egypt. I was stunned. I felt sick. I couldn’t believe someone could lie so easily and so deeply. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caveat: I am not against polygyny, so long as it’s done with clear intentions of supporting women and with transparency and consent of all involved. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 days later, one of them, Nadia (F, 50), contacted me. She told me he was a serial cheater who hid behind a religious mask — and that he had a long pattern of using women. I wanted to believe she was lying. But deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turned out the lifestyle he flaunted when we met — the flat, the car, the tech — wasn’t his doing at all. It was her money. Nadia was a civil servant, and she was the one paying rent on both his London and Scotland flats, covering all the bills, and she owned the car he drove. She had even given him a credit card with a £2000 limit! He had been living off her income and making himself appear self-made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And worse? Nadia was the “lodger” living in the flat he said was his. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept trying to make peace with the situation, despite paying £1,000+ a month in rent and bills on my own. He wasn’t helping. Eventually I reached a breaking point. It was more of an implosion than explosion. Emotionally detached and almost out of my own body, I quietly analysed him. He was a man who triangulated women and extracted from them as much as he could, to enable himself to live a “soft life”. I deeped how there was no love for me at all from his end and his manipulation gave me the “ick” that I could not unsee. And so I set a trap. I told him I planned to move back to the Seychelles and build a new life. I started taking actions towards this. Started talking about my dreams of living luxuriously and used examples of things we did on holiday there to build the picture of what life would be. I was also the picture of acceptance - discussing how he would need to be here in dreary England for half the year to be with his other wife as that’s what is islamically fair. I stopped reacting. I stopped clinging. I made space for myself and emotionally detached. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that’s when he started chasing me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nadia couldn’t handle it. She became increasingly anxious and threatened to harm herself if he left her. But he started pulling away from her more and more. She would send him increasingly more money to lure him back. He would say such terrible things about her. I am certain that with her, he would say terrible things about me. Eventually she walked in on us one day at his flat and had a breakdown. I had told him that if he wanted me to be a co-wife, this meant that any property in his name was equally shared and to inform her of this. I guess he didn’t. She stormed in, called me a whore over the phone to his mum. Then simultaneously held my hand and asked if I needed help to leave him. She was a husk of a person. This is what 7 years of hope and longing and disappointment - so much disappointment - had done to her. She packed up her stuff and left. She stole a few of his things in the process but to be fair, she did buy them. And to this day, he is not over that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I? I stayed. But I set new terms. I wasn’t paying rent or bills anymore. This was his flat, his responsibility. I reminded him of his Islamic obligations as a husband and told him I’d walk away if he couldn’t meet them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His face was a picture of shocked panic and horror. He had lost Nadia, his prized cash cow. He had made the wrong move. He had misread my intentions completely. He was so focused on his own deception that he did not expect to be deceived. From that point on, he was the one paying the bills. With the hopes that he would rectify his image in my eyes, hopes that we will be moving to Seychelles soon and he will be living off my dime, as he had originally planned.

They were acting like best friends while showing me I am out of the group and mobbing me. That was really painful to see.\n\nBut also here, their toxic behaviors didn't last long. They jealousy infected even their lifes. Especially when one of them bought a broken house and they renovated together. One was getting a new house, the other was working hard and didn't get nothing. For the price of friendship, not? Well, there friendship didn't last for ever and they lost contact now.\n\nMoral: Often you don't need to waste your time for revenge.

They were acting like best friends while showing me I am out of the group and mobbing me. That was really painful to see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But also here, their toxic behaviors didn&amp;#39;t last long. They jealousy infected even their lifes. Especially when one of them bought a broken house and they renovated together. One was getting a new house, the other was working hard and didn&amp;#39;t get nothing. For the price of friendship, not? Well, there friendship didn&amp;#39;t last for ever and they lost contact now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Moral: Often you don&amp;#39;t need to waste your time for revenge. Instead, work on you and see how they fail by their own. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

B has a personality disorder - think worse than psycho/sociopath. She lured Mark in with all the goods in the beginning, then by the time she showed her true colors, she had complete control of him. She tore him completely down psychologically, to where he literally thought he was worthless.\nShe would actually call him a worthless piece of shit, and he would take it. For the record, he has been through YEARS of therapy, and built himself back up to where he loves himself and has self worth again, and I try to reinforce that every day.\n\nFor background context, B is very high up in a well known MLM company that sells makeup. The one where you get a pink car if you do super well. She does do really well there because she is a master manipulator. In public she would be on Mark’s arm, being all lovey and happy; then in private she would basically psychologically torture him. \n\nHere is how the marriage ended: The day before B left Mark there was a big ceremony with her company where she had nominated Mark for husband of the year. She can make herself cry on command, so she cried and gave this big speech about how amazing he is, and how lucky she is. She had decorated his car for it (so everyone would see it in the parking lot). All her coworkers and family thought she was this amazing person, and she just lapped up all the attention. The next day Mark went to work, and when he got home the house was completely empty. B hired a moving company to move EVERYTHING out, and she left.\n\nMark eventually got some of his clothes and work stuff back, and got an apartment. As they’re going through the process of divorce, Mark has a background check done on her (he’s a cop/paramedic at this point). And he gets a file that shows MURDER charges against her. It was her boyfriend before she got together with Mark. She got off because she claimed it was an accident - that she accidentally fired a gun and it ricocheted and killed him. But there was evidence that he was shot in the back of the head point blank. I don’t know how she wasn’t convicted, I think a combination of her manipulation skills and holes in the justice system.\n\nMark just wanted to get as far away from her as possible, so he gave her the house, and everything else she asked for (even though he was entitled to 1/2) and screwed himself over, but he didn’t want to deal with her anymore.\n\nFast forward 7 years - Mark and I are very happily married. He gets on Facebook one day and sees one of his best friends who KNEW what a monster his wife was like had signed up as a sales rep under her. This friend (‘K’), had just been gradually worn down and convinced to join her. So now, Mark is upset because he thought K would never be influenced by her, but now she has. He wants to expose B and her record somehow. He knows her company would tear her apart if they knew, but he doesn’t want to hurt anyone else. B doesn’t know (as far as we know) that Mark knows about the murder charges; he did the background check secretly after they were separated, but I’m a little worried that she could trace it back to him. \n\nBut this woman DESTROYS lives. There is so much more; stories about her mistreating Mark’s kids, transphobic discrimination against coworkers etc. - way too much to explain here. Mark used to think about little stuff like rotten fish in her car etc., but now that K is involved, he wants to expose her so she’ll stop influencing &amp; manipulating women through the company.",

None of the people working there, besides the therapists, thought therapy was valid and viewed us as a waste of time and space, even the people running the place. I made a sexual harassment complaint against a man working there, not knowing that he was related to the guy who ran the place. Of course, nothing happened to him, but I became public enemy number one after that. They were obviously trying to make things bad for me, but I persevered because it was Covid and I needed to survive. \nOnce things calmed down, I decided that it was time to leave. It was the end of June and a lot of my boys would leave the program in July so I told the head of therapists that I would leave at the end of July to get those kids out, give me time to train the remaining therapists on the kids who would still be there after I left, and it would give them time to find a new therapist. She was grateful and said it was kind of me to do this. This was on a Monday, on Friday they called me into their office to tell me that they accepted my resignation that day and I could leave. They seemed surprised when I accepted that with a smile. I realized then that I could easily get my vengeance by being silent. Since I was no longer an employee I was not allowed back on the ground so someone had already packed my things for me. They did not let me say goodbye to my boys, so they got what was coming to them.\nWhat they didn’t know was that our IT guy was terrible at his job. He was supposed to create a file on each therapist’s computer so that we could put our files there and all the therapists could have access. Problem is he didn’t do it correctly on my computer and even though I told him this he never fixed it. Due to this, I just saved everything on my computer, but they would need my password to have access to that. I never gave it to them.\nI met with some of the therapists who still worked there for lunch about a month later. They were happy that I was doing better than when I was working there. Apparently, the head of therapists had to take over most of my caseload and had quit (she had only been in the job about three months when she left while I had lasted there for over two years). They had to rewrite a ton of my paperwork since they could not get access to my computer which helped cause her frustration and final decision to leave. After how the other therapists saw how I was treated, most of them left soon after and the only one to remain was terrible at her job. In their desperation to replace the therapists fast enough they even rehired a therapist that had left previously who was so bad at her job that she was deeply hated by every kid on her caseload. (Funny thing about that therapist is that she was cruel to me and I got my vengeance on her as well since her husband began flirting with me on Facebook, I let it go on for a bit and then sent her pictures of his messages to me. I don’t know what happened after that but I assume their marriage had some difficulties) It seems that the place never really recovered when it came to the therapy department, and the sad part is that’s where most of their funding came from. Funny how people put down those who they truly rely on.",

I never gave it to them.\nI met with some of the therapists who still worked there for lunch about a month later. They were happy that I was doing better than when I was working there. Apparently, the head of therapists had to take over most of my caseload and had quit (she had only been in the job about three months when she left while I had lasted there for over two years). They had to rewrite a ton of my paperwork since they could not get access to my computer which helped cause her frustration and final decision to leave. After how the other therapists saw how I was treated, most of them left soon after and the only one to remain was terrible at her job. In their desperation to replace the therapists fast enough they even rehired a therapist that had left previously who was so bad at her job that she was deeply hated by every kid on her caseload. (Funny thing about that therapist is that she was cruel to me and I got my vengeance on her as well since her husband began flirting with me on Facebook, I let it go on for a bit and then sent her pictures of his messages to me. I don’t know what happened after that but I assume their marriage had some difficulties) It seems that the place never really recovered when it came to the therapy department, and the sad part is that’s where most of their funding came from. Funny how people put down those who they truly rely on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Even though I wouldn’t describe myself as an exemplary person, I always try to do good if possible and not let things I can’t change affect me.\n\nHowever, this thing I am going through has affected me very throughly and I guess I am  at my boiling point. \n\nThis actually starts at my early childhood, when our dad impregnated his mistress and my parents then divorced. Obviously, I didn’t know at that time, but as he made me and my brother meet his new family over time, I slowly realized the truth. The weird thing is, my dad was actually the sweetest and kindest parent growing up, while my mom was very unstable and abusive. He always apologized if he so much as raised his voice and tried to always please us. I was upset with his past, but I basically never brought it up.\n\nEverything changed this Autumn. \n\nMy father has been afflicted with many illnesses for as long as I remember, but for the last couple years he developed lung cancer, which he did overcome, but then metastasis appeared in his brain. I visited him as much as I could and always tried to get him to quit smoking and to eat healthier. He made me promise not to tell anything to my grandmother (his mother, who was distraught after her husband’s passing. He also had cancer) and even though I hated being dishonest, I agreed.\n\nObviously this didn’t last long and she called me during my uni midterms with a very alarmed voice. Apparently she found out he had cancer and went to visit him with sweets and extra money she had accumulated over the years. (Pretty hefty sum by our country’s standards). She got berated by my father’s wife over her not accepting her due to what happened with my parents. She then got kicked out by my father and he still doesn’t talk to her. I was absolutely shocked by this behavior and after a week of mulling over this and becoming more upset, I called my dad, criticized his behavior and just venting about the adultery and everything I haven’t ever told him. I even called his wife a whore, which she is. After him continuing lying to me about very obvious things, I hung up because I couldn’t get to him. 2 days later, my grandma is telling me that my dad is taking away me and my brother’s tuition money that was at her place. I went to her place and she passed me the phone after she talked to my dad. When I asked him why he was doing this. He said it was for his treatment and told me I wanted him to die, didn’t stop cursing my grandma (unimaginable thing to do against one’s parent in my culture) and said I wanted his death again and again and again. I was absolutely in hysterics. My heart couldn’t stop beating and I told him to take everything and never talk to me again. I went months without contacting him and couldn’t believe my sweet dad, who always cherished us and did everything for his friends and family, could do such a thing. My grandma, unlike me or my brother, still tried to talk with his only son, but he was very bitter towards her and even in our talk said that she poisoned us against him. She did no such thing and actually insisted that we be more understanding towards our dying father. Obviously, I also thought that and was mentally torturing myself for months on end. Eventually I mustered up the courage to call him and he agreed that I’d come up to his house.\n\nWhat happened there is…something.\n\nHis bitch wife tried just about everything to get under my skin and even my dad said the most cutting remarks. She also unintentionally admitted that she basically did that to my grandma as well during our conversation. I realized what was happening and, despite my hot temper, managed to stay clear-headed and ended our meeting in a civil way and hugged it out with my dad. Things are still tense and I need help with how to fight with that woman. \n\nI’ve genuinely contemplated just ending her, but my family is warning against it. She basically poisons his mind and managed to take control of all his resources by putting all of his property on either hers or her family members’ names. I don’t care about her wealth but I don’t want such an evil person to win in the end. No one should build happiness on other people’s misery. There’s many horrible things she has done, that I hadn’t mentioned, but you get the gist.\n\nSo how do I do it? How do I ruin her life? I’m not ever superstitious and I’m willing to consider curses. I don’t even care about going to hell anymore.\n\nI’d appreciate any advice or idea! ",

Right by my side (and my space is bad and narrow enough already as is, between an actual wall and this guy) there's this guy who owns a ever-so-slightly bigger car than mine, who very rarely moves it. Thing is he parks it SO close to the very edge of my car, leaving almost no space for me to maneuver or exit my car after parking as a human being without trampling over the gear stick. I see there's a column by his car's furthest side from me, but he's still has so much more space left than what he's leaving me. This is already mildly infuriating, but I would be (I guess) okay since I'm young (still) and agile - my mum, not so much. I haven't ever seen him or his spawn around, so I haven't had the chance to ask him politely to stop being an asshole, but my mother has and she was very rudely dismissed. I'm not taking that. Hence I'm asking for ways I could get back at him and doesn't point any fingers right at my (or my mum's) face. There's also a camera pointing in our direction so I'd have to be discreet. What do you suggest? \n\nEdit: I thought this was the revenge stories sub, why are you all suggesting politeness? We are WAY past that stage the moment he was rude when we asked the first time. Legally I haven't much else to do, as he is parked TOTALLY between his lines. There's no parking manager to speak to about it as each parking slot is privately owned, separately. And even if it was, confronting him (again) isn't an option because that would totally point ALL the fingers at me. The previous owner had a much smaller car and she wasn't such a big prick, that's why we bought our space. The option we'd have is to sell our parking spot and try and buy a different one, but they are really contested and kind of expensive as I live in a dense area and everybody wants a spot. ",

Right by my side (and my space is bad and narrow enough already as is, between an actual wall and this guy) there&amp;#39;s this guy who owns a ever-so-slightly bigger car than mine, who very rarely moves it. Thing is he parks it SO close to the very edge of my car, leaving almost no space for me to maneuver or exit my car after parking as a human being without trampling over the gear stick. I see there&amp;#39;s a column by his car&amp;#39;s furthest side from me, but he&amp;#39;s still has so much more space left than what he&amp;#39;s leaving me. This is already mildly infuriating, but I would be (I guess) okay since I&amp;#39;m young (still) and agile - my mum, not so much. I haven&amp;#39;t ever seen him or his spawn around, so I haven&amp;#39;t had the chance to ask him politely to stop being an asshole, but my mother has and she was very rudely dismissed. I&amp;#39;m not taking that. Hence I&amp;#39;m asking for ways I could get back at him and doesn&amp;#39;t point any fingers right at my (or my mum&amp;#39;s) face. There&amp;#39;s also a camera pointing in our direction so I&amp;#39;d have to be discreet. What do you suggest? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I thought this was the revenge stories sub, why are you all suggesting politeness? We are WAY past that stage the moment he was rude when we asked the first time. Legally I haven&amp;#39;t much else to do, as he is parked TOTALLY between his lines. There&amp;#39;s no parking manager to speak to about it as each parking slot is privately owned, separately. And even if it was, confronting him (again) isn&amp;#39;t an option because that would totally point ALL the fingers at me. The previous owner had a much smaller car and she wasn&amp;#39;t such a big prick, that&amp;#39;s why we bought our space. The option we&amp;#39;d have is to sell our parking spot and try and buy a different one, but they are really contested and kind of expensive as I live in a dense area and everybody wants a spot. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I dated a guy for a year before being abruptly dumped out of nowhere. Come to find out later it was because of a female friend of his who&amp;#39;s been flirting with him secretly the entire relationship. I guess he got in his head that he would finally be able to bag her when he dumped. Turns out she was just flirting for attention and he dumped me for no reason. I already got my revenge on my jackals ex boyfriend. I want revenge on the girl now because it hurts knowing that I was nice to this girl the entire time she was disrespecting me behind my back. Feels like a double betrayal. Emotional trauma on multiple fronts. She doesn&amp;#39;t know that I know what happened between them. What should I do? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I’ve been trying to hold on to the fragments of this friendship because I just want to see her do what’s best for her and I thought we had an understanding but now I know how she really thinks and feels about me. I have no idea how I’m gonna let her know I know.  so that’s why I’m asking y’all. We’re both about to graduate college in two weeks so I really don’t have time to get emotional about this but come May 18. I’m putting said plan into action.\n\n",

I’ve been trying to hold on to the fragments of this friendship because I just want to see her do what’s best for her and I thought we had an understanding but now I know how she really thinks and feels about me. I have no idea how I’m gonna let her know I know.  so that’s why I’m asking y’all. We’re both about to graduate college in two weeks so I really don’t have time to get emotional about this but come May 18. I’m putting said plan into action.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The old man is a bigoted, incontinent, coprophobic POS and I sincerely hope he suffers when that withered black thing in his chest finally does the world a favor and quits.  Over the 6 weeks I’ve been staying there I have: driven him to the clinic, filled out his paperwork, literally caught him when he fell, bought him a new bong when he broke his, bought groceries. cleaned the house all while looking for a job in a new city. Point is, I tried to be kind and tried to contribute to the house. \nThe problem was, I poop.  I honestly grew up thinking EVERYBODY did it, but apparently it’s just me.  And one time I forgot to flush.  Oh, and I didn’t grow up in a house where lighting a candle was a thing.  Admittedly, there was electric when I grew up up but I digress. \n\nWhen I was made aware of my indiscretion I was verbally assaulted after having trash thrown at my feet.  Today however, sensing some animosity I asked him if I’d offended him to which he responded that my very existence offended him and proceeded to make accusations and  berate me.  Refusing to let me get a single word in until I exploded!  I have like, off the charts ADHD and am probably autistic or have some serious trauma issues. Among my triggers are lies and justice sensitivity and honestly I’m not proud of how loud I got or the words I shouted (mostly “fuck you! you shit stain” variations on a Theme). I stormed out slamming the door so hard I probably broke it.  I definitely fucked up the back gate.  Anyway, yes, plans of revenge are forthcoming. \n\nWhen I came back I started packing.  I didn’t have much there and most of it was still in bins so it went pretty quick but I was also fueled with rage.  Rage is good fuel.  Being ADHD my mind was absolutely spinning.  I have to go back tomorrow to get some of the last items and while I’m pretty sure I won’t be allowed in the house without supervision here’s a list of things I WANT to do but know I can’t. \n\nSmear “Jeffey Makes poopies too” on his bathroom mirror in dog shit.  \n\nLeave a note to clarify whether or not the toothbrush in his cup on his side of the vanity was for detailing the toilet?\n\nUse said toothbrush to detail aforementioned toilet.\n\nLeave a full doggy bag hanging on his bedroom doorknob, not tied shut \n\nGo to every porn shop and rest stop in the greater metro area and write on a toilet stall:\n“Hello, I’m baby Jeffy.  I’m so ashamed to admit it but I love big messy poopies!  The only way I can even get off anymore is looking at pictures of nasty turds. Please! Please text me your biggest, grossest shit pix day or night! 555-555-5555 -baby jeffy.\n\nShow up tomorrow to grab the last of my things with Nutella smeared all over my face.\n\nLeave a signed copy of “everybody poops” on his chair \n\nSmear Nutella on his chair \n\nSmear dogshit on his chair.\n\nShit on his bed. \n\nWait a week or two and send him some dookie pix after I go out for Indian food\n\nI know this is all pretty weak shit, (pun impacted) so I’m open to any better ideas since I have no intention of actually following through. \n\n\n",

                  "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of exposition here. Sorry.\nI’m 46m (queer, it might be pertinent) and lived with a married couple and the 73 year old man they adopted until this morning. The old man is a bigoted, incontinent, coprophobic POS and I sincerely hope he suffers when that withered black thing in his chest finally does the world a favor and quits.  Over the 6 weeks I’ve been staying there I have: driven him to the clinic, filled out his paperwork, literally caught him when he fell, bought him a new bong when he broke his, bought groceries. cleaned the house all while looking for a job in a new city. Point is, I tried to be kind and tried to contribute to the house. \nThe problem was, I poop.  I honestly grew up thinking EVERYBODY did it, but apparently it’s just me.  And one time I forgot to flush.  Oh, and I didn’t grow up in a house where lighting a candle was a thing.  Admittedly, there was electric when I grew up up but I digress. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I was made aware of my indiscretion I was verbally assaulted after having trash thrown at my feet.  Today however, sensing some animosity I asked him if I’d offended him to which he responded that my very existence offended him and proceeded to make accusations and  berate me.  Refusing to let me get a single word in until I exploded!  I have like, off the charts ADHD and am probably autistic or have some serious trauma issues. Among my triggers are lies and justice sensitivity and honestly I’m not proud of how loud I got or the words I shouted (mostly “fuck you! you shit stain” variations on a Theme). I stormed out slamming the door so hard I probably broke it.  I definitely fucked up the back gate.  Anyway, yes, plans of revenge are forthcoming. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I came back I started packing.  I didn’t have much there and most of it was still in bins so it went pretty quick but I was also fueled with rage.  Rage is good fuel.  Being ADHD my mind was absolutely spinning.  I have to go back tomorrow to get some of the last items and while I’m pretty sure I won’t be allowed in the house without supervision here’s a list of things I WANT to do but know I can’t. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smear “Jeffey Makes poopies too” on his bathroom mirror in dog shit.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leave a note to clarify whether or not the toothbrush in his cup on his side of the vanity was for detailing the toilet?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use said toothbrush to detail aforementioned toilet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leave a full doggy bag hanging on his bedroom doorknob, not tied shut &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to every porn shop and rest stop in the greater metro area and write on a toilet stall:\n“Hello, I’m baby Jeffy.  I’m so ashamed to admit it but I love big messy poopies!  The only way I can even get off anymore is looking at pictures of nasty turds. Please! Please text me your biggest, grossest shit pix day or night! 555-555-5555 -baby jeffy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Show up tomorrow to grab the last of my things with Nutella smeared all over my face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leave a signed copy of “everybody poops” on his chair &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smear Nutella on his chair &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smear dogshit on his chair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shit on his bed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait a week or two and send him some dookie pix after I go out for Indian food&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this is all pretty weak shit, (pun impacted) so I’m open to any better ideas since I have no intention of actually following through. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

A week later, she broke down and thought maybe breaking up wasn’t such a good idea after all. We decided to move into separate places but try to keep the relationship going—hoping that a little distance might reignite the spark after five years together.\n\nNow, three months later, I found out that she has actually been with her new \"friend\" this whole time. So basically, she kept me around as a backup in case that relationship didn’t work out. What hurts even more is that, during the time we were still living together before moving out, she acted extremely loving toward me—like nothing had changed.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, she told me she can’t see me anymore. She doesn’t know that I’ve found out about the cheating. I got the information from that “friend” of hers, who thought I was someone else entirely. I now suspect that this guy knows nothing about me at all. I think my ex told him we were just roommates—since we had separate rooms in the shared house and didn’t have public couple photos, that was probably easy to explain.\n\nDo you have any ideas on what I should do in this situation? Right now, the best option seems to be blocking her everywhere. But part of me also wants her to know that I know she cheated. Or even let her family know what kind of person she really is.\n\n",

A week later, she broke down and thought maybe breaking up wasn’t such a good idea after all. We decided to move into separate places but try to keep the relationship going—hoping that a little distance might reignite the spark after five years together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, three months later, I found out that she has actually been with her new &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; this whole time. So basically, she kept me around as a backup in case that relationship didn’t work out. What hurts even more is that, during the time we were still living together before moving out, she acted extremely loving toward me—like nothing had changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, she told me she can’t see me anymore. She doesn’t know that I’ve found out about the cheating. I got the information from that “friend” of hers, who thought I was someone else entirely. I now suspect that this guy knows nothing about me at all. I think my ex told him we were just roommates—since we had separate rooms in the shared house and didn’t have public couple photos, that was probably easy to explain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you have any ideas on what I should do in this situation? Right now, the best option seems to be blocking her everywhere. But part of me also wants her to know that I know she cheated. Or even let her family know what kind of person she really is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

                      "selftext": "A few years ago I was dating a guy, we'll call him Erik. We had been together for about a year and in my mind I thought we were exclusive. Turns out, only I was the exclusive one, but that's a story for another time. He had a traveling job that took him all around the state of Texas so he was only home about 10 days a month. When he was home, he would stay at my house. I thought things were great. That was until my birthday came up. He started acting funny, very distant and cold. We didn't do anything for my birthday. No dinner, flowers, nothing. I don't expect the world to stop spinning on my birthday but I didn't even get a card and he never even wished me a happy birthday. He was home for a few days then back to work he went. So I started to put distance between us for a few weeks. Fast-forward to the next time he came home. He still came to my house for a few days so I thought things would go back to normal. Nope. Still distant. Couple days later he left for work again so I started thinking he was just using me for a place to stay while he was in town so he wouldn't have to stay at his mom's house. I worked 6-2 at a nursing home so I was already gone when he left. When I got home I noticed he emptied his wallet and left the papers (receipts and other random crap) on my coffee table. In that little pile was a small piece of paper that had his ex-girlfriend's (we'll call her Sarah) login info to her social media accounts. Weird. No wonder why they broke up if they distrusted one another so much that they needed to have the login to the other person's account lmao. I took that paper and went to his mom's house to use her laptop (this was 2011). I got in! In his phone he had deleted chats between them so I didn't know they were talking. She deleted nothing. They had been hooking up for a couple months. She would drive to wherever he was and stay with him at the motels. She had even messaged him photos of the times they spent together. Come to find out they had gone to a bar together for St. Patrick's Day when he had told me that he couldn't come home because he was on \"storm duty\". I was fuming. But she was also hooking up with other men. MANY other men. As a matter of fact, a couple of them were MARRIED! And she knew they were married because she would also meet them at motels. Disgusting. And again she shared pics of the encounters with them. If you're going to cheat, why would you be stupid enough to photograph that? AnyWho, I came across a chat between her and her Best friend’s fiancé. Of course I opened it, at this point I'm INVESTED. She was seeing him too behind her friends’ back! (who was pregnant at the time by the way). I saw the pictures and my heart dropped. I knew I had to do something. This b**ch has gone too far. I saved the pics then went to the best friend's fb and posted them from the homewrecker's account for everyone to see. Of course they had a gazillion mutual friends so half of the county saw those pictures. I didn't tell anyone for several years but looking back now, I still would've done the same thing. AITAH?",

We had been together for about a year and in my mind I thought we were exclusive. Turns out, only I was the exclusive one, but that&amp;#39;s a story for another time. He had a traveling job that took him all around the state of Texas so he was only home about 10 days a month. When he was home, he would stay at my house. I thought things were great. That was until my birthday came up. He started acting funny, very distant and cold. We didn&amp;#39;t do anything for my birthday. No dinner, flowers, nothing. I don&amp;#39;t expect the world to stop spinning on my birthday but I didn&amp;#39;t even get a card and he never even wished me a happy birthday. He was home for a few days then back to work he went. So I started to put distance between us for a few weeks. Fast-forward to the next time he came home. He still came to my house for a few days so I thought things would go back to normal. Nope. Still distant. Couple days later he left for work again so I started thinking he was just using me for a place to stay while he was in town so he wouldn&amp;#39;t have to stay at his mom&amp;#39;s house. I worked 6-2 at a nursing home so I was already gone when he left. When I got home I noticed he emptied his wallet and left the papers (receipts and other random crap) on my coffee table. In that little pile was a small piece of paper that had his ex-girlfriend&amp;#39;s (we&amp;#39;ll call her Sarah) login info to her social media accounts. Weird. No wonder why they broke up if they distrusted one another so much that they needed to have the login to the other person&amp;#39;s account lmao.

Also i made her centre of my world and i was completely spending my whole time with her , helping  with her PhD work , catering to her needs. i totally lost myself. I had a mental collapse by Dec and i was admitted to hospital, the doctor after 5 days of therapy asked me to go and break up with her , so i did as he asked and broke up with her on jan 02,  she insisted on march date  but i held my ground. so post breakups it been 2.5 months , last 2 months i cried almost every day and i deeply miss her , this month onwards i feel a sense of anger towards her. She got her Phd( for which i put considerable effort) + she is looking for a job and getting married in few months to her boyfriend . I lost my job , i am heartbroken and i have issues with productivity and pain and on treatment for emotional stress shocks. i dont know how to get back on my feet , we are in no contact but sometime back she texted me' after few years this will go away and we can be close friends '.i hate myself because my friends , my doctor and my family had all warned me at every stage to walk out and they are not surprised at my eventuality .\n\nshe got promoted and is getting married to her boyfriend \n\nI take complete responsibility for my actions \n\nI was really emotionally abused in this relationship.. \nI want to  get back at her btw it should not damage her life or anything.. something light!  so that she atleast understands what i went through ",

Also i made her centre of my world and i was completely spending my whole time with her , helping  with her PhD work , catering to her needs. i totally lost myself. I had a mental collapse by Dec and i was admitted to hospital, the doctor after 5 days of therapy asked me to go and break up with her , so i did as he asked and broke up with her on jan 02,  she insisted on march date  but i held my ground. so post breakups it been 2.5 months , last 2 months i cried almost every day and i deeply miss her , this month onwards i feel a sense of anger towards her. She got her Phd( for which i put considerable effort) + she is looking for a job and getting married in few months to her boyfriend . I lost my job , i am heartbroken and i have issues with productivity and pain and on treatment for emotional stress shocks. i dont know how to get back on my feet , we are in no contact but sometime back she texted me&amp;#39; after few years this will go away and we can be close friends &amp;#39;.i hate myself because my friends , my doctor and my family had all warned me at every stage to walk out and they are not surprised at my eventuality .&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;she got promoted and is getting married to her boyfriend &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take complete responsibility for my actions &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was really emotionally abused in this relationship.. \nI want to  get back at her btw it should not damage her life or anything.. something light!  so that she atleast understands what i went through &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We did meet up in person, but still spend most our time calling and texting with eachother. He loved me alot and was a very sweet boy, until i noticed some strange behaviour in him. He forbid me to talk to his friends but i did anyway, since one of them wished me a happy birthday. \nMe and that friend started texting more and more, and he startet telling me about how Im not as big of a bitch as my ex always said I was, even tho we were still tg when he said that. Me and that dude then told eachother more and more about the lies my ex, lets call him Peter, told us about eachother. Turns out, to them Im a manipulative bitch thats super jealous and doesnt let Peter talk to anyone, which is obviosuly a lie. \nAnd to me they are selfcentered assholes that are like super misogynistic and weird, which is also not true. Now i didnt imidiatly ask Peter wth was up with him since I wanted to see if i can get more info out of his friends. Turns out all his friends hate him. One of them sent me a screenshot where he was making a joke about how he manipulates me and lies to me and thats when i snaped. Me and two of his friends called him and confronted him about everything he said and he apologized poorly and told us some kinda made up excuses, stupid as i was i forgave him.\n\nThough after that, I noticed my feelings for him starting to change. I didnt wanna spend time with him anymore and felt super drained whenever we did smt together. After like 3 or 4 months of an on-off phase with Peter, we decidet to break up. At first it was a peaceful breakup, we decidet to stay friends and everything but then all of a sudden he got very weird. I decidet to start talking to his friends again, asking their opinions and what they would do in my situation. This all started yesterday/ the day before that. They told me every secret about him and i told them everything i knew as well. Turns out that dude did all of this behind eachothers backs: he text w other girls while we were together, got nudes from them, had a crush and asked one of his (male!!) Friends if he would have sex with him, lied and manipulated everyone around him, lastly has an addiction to smoking, vaping and weed, told my gay BROTHER that if i didnt exist he would be dating him, told his friends that one week after we broke up he already had a new girl (that girl has a boyfriend and went balistic on me for asking if she thinks Peter has a crush on her and got all mad that im a horrible person for ending the realationship). So now I've got that dude blocked for abt 2 or 3 days, and Im still talking to all of his \"friends\" that hate him now aswell. Im plotting revenge, probably exposing him, maybe making him loose the friends that he still had, making sure he doesnt get a job too soon (i have screenshots of him saying the n-word) but i think thats all a little much. I still want him to feel how horrible i am doing rn.\nAlso forgot to mention: he doesnt know that i know any of this and he still wants to get back together with me",
